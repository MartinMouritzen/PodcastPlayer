# Podcast Player

While working on the [Podcast player Podfriend](https://www.podfriend.com), I began using [podcastindex.org](http://podcastindex.org), and a challenge came out on one of their podcasts to build a HTML5 webplayer, so I did.

I hope someone can use it to get a head start into building something amazing!
